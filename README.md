# OpenConnect Companion (Tauri)

**OpenConnectCompanion-Tauri** is a cross-platform native desktop application for synchronizing, analyzing, and visualizing data from Garmin smartwatches, cycling computers, and Strava Activities.

It aims to provide a feature set identical to **Garmin Connect™**, while staying lightweight, fully open-source, and free from unnecessary bloat. OpenConnectCompanion is privacy-first (all data stays on your device) and does not rely on any Garmin services.
